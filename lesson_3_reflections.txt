When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating or working from multiple locations/computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There could potentially be conflicts if someone else has worked in the same branch?
