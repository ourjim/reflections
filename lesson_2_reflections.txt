What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git folder is created to keep track of commit meta data for
	revision histories to the files that you wish to add.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to group multiple files into a particular commit.
	Files wchich are logically unrelated do not need to be commtted together.
	This means less file commits overall, keeping the complexity down when
	searching your commit histories.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I don't know the answer to this question

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Milestones can be labelled. Experiments can be made without affecting the main
	branch. It makes it easy to manage multiple directions for the code.
